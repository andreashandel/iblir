## Description

`iblir` is an R package containing a set of
[`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/)/Shiny tutorials that cover
basic biostatistical concepts.

## Information for users

### Getting Started

Start by installing R and RStudio. The package is not yet on CRAN, so
you need to install it from GitHub as follows.

    install.packages('remotes')
    library('remotes')
    install_github('andreashandel/iblir')

Then load the package

    library('iblir')

To start the tutorials/labs, you type

    run_tutorial('LabN', package = 'iblir')

where N is the lab number (1-13), e.g., `Lab1`, `Lab2`.

A startup message also tells you this.

### Further information
