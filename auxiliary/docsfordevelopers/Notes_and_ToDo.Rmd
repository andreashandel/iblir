## To-Do

### Need to do

* Test that all ways of using/modifying the labs as described in the vignette works robustly.
* Test that all labs work, both locally and remote.
* Change labs such that each one only loads the 'iblir' package, no other packages. That iblir package in turn should list all required packages in the DESCRIPTION file.
* Remove additional Rmd file from labs 1 and 10.
* Further clean up all labs, remove any unused files. Possibly have all files for labs just in a single folder, e.g. just `www`? 
* Update logo


### Could do

* Add more features to deploy_labs, e.g. user can specify which account.
* Auto-generate a (GitHub) website that can serve as landing page for the labs for a course.
* Figure out a way that for local deployment in which users just call one function which opens a graphical menu from which to choose labs.
* write more testthat tests


## General Notes and Thoughts

* see the documentation.md file for general information

* Example of another R package consisting of learnR tutorials:
