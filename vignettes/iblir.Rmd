## Summary

Home of the future vignette.

## Contributing to the package
The package is on GitHub and you can use the usual GitHub process to file bug reports, send feature requests, contribute updates and bug fixes, etc. If you have any comments or feedback, I very much welcome them. Please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ahgroup/DSAIDE/issues) and let me know what you think.

The package is built in a way that makes it (hopefully) easy for others to contribute new simulations/apps. To that end, the package contains [this Markdown file](https://github.com/ahgroup/DSAIDE/blob/master/auxiliary/docsfordevelopers/documentation.md) which provides further information on the details of the package structure. If you plan to develop new apps, or make other substantial contributions, it's best to get in touch with me first via email or GitHub.

## Further information
See the [package website](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/) for useful additional information.
